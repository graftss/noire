# Noire

Noire is an input display designed for livestream layouts, plus a editor to create highly customizable displays. It was originally conceived of as a way to make the unique, dual-analog input of Katamari series games visually legible.

## Features

- Live editor for creating, customizing, and testing input displays.
- Instantly serialize, share, and import input displays as JSON.
- Built-in single-color background designed to work with stream layout chroma keying.
